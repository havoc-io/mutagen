	// It appears that both sides have been modified. Before we mark a conflict,

	// is essentially the only form of automated conflict resolution that we can
	// do. In some sense, it is a heuristic designed to avoid conflicts in very
	// common cases, but more importantly, it is necessary to enable our form of
	// manual conflict resolution: having the user delete the side they don't
	// want to keep.
	//
	// Now, you're probably asking yourself a few questions here:
	//
	// Why didn't we simply make this check first? Why do we need to check the
	// full diffs above? Well, imagine that one side had deleted and the other
	// was unmodified. If we only looked at non-deletion changes, we would not
	// detect this because both sides would have no changes or deletion-only
	// changes, and both lists below would be empty, and the winning side would
	// be determined simply by the ordering of the conditional statement below
	// (essentially beta would always win out as it is currently structured).
	//
	// What if both sides have completely deleted this node? Well, that would
	// have passed the equality check at the start of the function and would
	// have been treated as a both-deleted scenario. Thus, we know at least one
	// side has content at this node.
	//
	// What if both sides are directories and have only deleted some subset of
	// the tree below here? Well, that would ALSO have passed the equality check
	// above since nothing has changed at this node, and the function would have
	// simply recursed.
	//
	// Note that, when recording these changes, we use the side we're going to
	// overrule as the "old" value in the change, because that's what it should
	// expect to see on disk, not the ancestor. And since that "old" must be a
	// subtree of ancestor (it contains only deletion changes), it still
	// represents a valid value to return from a transition in the case that the
	// transition fails, and, as a nice side-effect in that case, no information
	// about the deletions that have happened on that side is lost.
